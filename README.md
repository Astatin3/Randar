# Randar-Minimap

A Quick and dirty minimap using the Randar exploit

100% of the credit for this goes to https://github.com/spawnmason/randar-explanation   
Their work is really cool.


### Commands
- **.randar help** - print this help info
- **.randar clear** - clear map data
- **.randar getseed** - print current seed
- **.rander setseed \<seed>** - set current seed

### Settings
- **Seed** - The seed of the map
- **Map corner** - The corner of the screen that the map is displayed in
- **Map range** - The maximum borders of the radar
- **Color** - The color of the detected areas
- **Heatmap mode** - Enable showing the age of detected regions using brightness
- **Size** - The size of the map on screen
- **Smear** - Stretch detected regions out to make them more visible
- **Radar mode** - Center radar at player pos, not 0, 0
- **Verbose** - Enable original debug output



##### How do I run this?   
- Add the mod alongside Meteor client as an addon   
##### If Meteor client is on the latest version and the Randar exploit only works on versions up until 1.12.2, then how can I possibly use this?
- Use: https://modrinth.com/mod/viafabricplus (Another really cool mod)

Also quick note:
- I have never made a Minecraft mod before
- I have never worked with Fabric before
- I have never made a Meteor client addon before
- So if there is anything that can be made better, leave an issue!
