# Randar-Minimap

A Quick and dirty minimap using the Randar exploit

100% of the credit for this goes to https://github.com/spawnmason/randar-explanation   
Their work is really cool.

##### How do I run this?   
- Add the mod alongside Meteor client as an addon   
##### If Meteor client is on the latest version and the Randar exploit only works on versions up until 1.12.2, then how can I possibly use this?
- Use: https://modrinth.com/mod/viafabricplus (Another really cool mod)

Also quick note:
- I have never made a Minecraft mod before
- I have never worked with Fabric before
- I have never made a Meteor client addon before
- So if there is anything that can be made better, leave an issue!
